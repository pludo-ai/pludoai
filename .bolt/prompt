For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.


// MEMORY CONTEXT:
// Pludo.AI is a no-code tool that lets any user ‚Äî even with zero tech background ‚Äî generate a fully personalized AI chatbot assistant that floats on their website. The user (called Puser) fills in basic details like brand name, services, agent tone, and color scheme. Then, Pludo handles everything:
// - Stores user info in Supabase
// - Pushes a private GitHub repo with agent template + their custom data
// - Deploys it automatically to Vercel
// - Returns a simple JS script to embed on any website

// The chatbot is powered by OpenRouter AI (DeepSeek for live chat, Mistral for prompt tuning). A key feature is that users can update the bot's memory through a visual Memory Editor ‚Äî this content is stored in their `knowledge.txt` file in GitHub and used as part of the AI's system prompt.

// UI/UX is central: sleek, modern, interactive, not dev-looking. Designed to feel like Google or Linear's website ‚Äî with real animations, spacing, responsiveness, and clarity. This is not just functional, it's visually engaging and frictionless.

// THE GOAL: Create a fully automated system where someone fills a form, and walks away with a hosted, intelligent, branded chatbot.
